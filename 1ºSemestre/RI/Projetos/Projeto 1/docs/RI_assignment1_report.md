# Information Retrieval - Assignment 1 Report Guidelines


This document outlines what we expect to see in the file **Assignment 1/README.md**


## Configurations instructions for executing the code


## Indexer Engine


Include the following in this section:


- Description of the tokenizer and its implemented options
- Any optimization techniques that were implemented
- File format of the index written to disk (include a screenshot of the open index file)
- Brief description of the SPIMI algorithm implementation, specifically addressing how you handled memory constraints
- Total indexing time for the collection (you may report times for different configurations)


Additionally:
- List any features you know are missing from your implementation
- Include any relevant comparisons between different configurations tested during development that were important to your design decisions. 


## Search Engine


Include the following in this section:


- Description of the implemented search algorithms
- Any optimization techniques used to improve search performance
- Average query processing time


Additionally:
- Features you know are missing from your implementation
- Comparisons between different experimental configurations tested during development


## Ranking Metrics 


Report the nDCG@10 scores obtained when running each search algorithm on the 100 provided questions.


## Additional Information


- Showcase your Command Line Interface by including the help menu output (e.g., --help)


## Conclusion


Address the following:
- Strengths (and weaknesses) of your implementation
- Areas for improvement
- Key challenges encountered
